All the files can be run with just changing the file location in the first block of the code.

All the train datasets for a particular handwritten character or spoken digit must be present in the same folder.
All the development datasets for a particular handwritten character or spoken digit must be present in the same folder.

When the number of train or the development data for particular input differs, the range in the for loops has to be changed in every code.

If test data is to be run on any code, then the development data variables and the number of datasets should be replaced.
